But first, let me introduce myself. I'm Leonardo Budhi Satrio Utomo. I'm a geophysical engineering undergraduate student at Bandung Institute of Technology. Currently, I'm interested in applying ML to geophysical data processing. My goal is to reduce the time and costs at geophysical data processing but still produce high-quality results to help Indonesia achieve The National Energy Mix Target by 2030.
